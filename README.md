Udacity Android Developer Movie Stage 2 App

# Editing the API Key
This application requires the use of an API key from [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/). Please add your own API key in your local gradle.properties file located in the application root.

# Project Notes
A first attempt at several things, most noteably in using injection, LiveData and following MVVM app architecture - biting of far more than one could chew in the process - but eventually learning a lot. Incredibly enjoyable and challenging process. 

# Notable
Offline access gained through the combination of a ROOM database (initially using 'one true source' methodology) and utilising Picasso image caching features.

# Future Intentions
I intend to return to this project to more fully utilise Dagger injection.
